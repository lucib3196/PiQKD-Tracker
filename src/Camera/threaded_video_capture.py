"""
Overview:
This script tests camera functionality and threading performance.
It creates a threaded video stream using OpenCV to capture video frames from a webcam
and overlays the frames per second (FPS) on the video.

Key Features:
1. **Threaded Video Capture:**
   - Continuously captures frames in a separate thread to enhance performance.
   - Reduces latency caused by frame grabbing in the main thread.

2. **FPS Overlay:**
   - Calculates and displays the current FPS on each video frame.

3. **Usability:**
   - Press 'q' to exit the video stream.

Modules Used:
- threading: For running the video capture in a separate thread.
- OpenCV (cv2): For capturing and displaying video frames.
- Custom `fps` module: Tracks and overlays FPS on the video frames.
