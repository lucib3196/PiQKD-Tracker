"""
This script demonstrates basic control of two servos using the GPIO Zero library.

Servos:
- Base Servo: Controls the base and oscillates between -90째 and 90째.
- Upper Servo: Controls the upper section and oscillates between -45째 and 45째.

How it works:
1. The script initializes two AngularServo objects, each tied to specific GPIO pins.
2. In an infinite loop, it moves the base servo and upper servo to their minimum and maximum angles with a delay.
3. Use this script to verify servo connections and test basic movement.

Note:
- Ensure the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins are properly connected to the servo's signal pin.
- Provide external power to the servos if needed, as GPIO pins cannot supply sufficient current for servos under load.
- If running this script over SSH, use `sudo` to ensure GPIO permissions.

Requirements:
- GPIO Zero library: Install it with `pip install gpiozero`
